    "\n",
    "- Epistemic uncertainty: is the uncertainty due to the lack of knowledge. In ML terms, this corresponds to the case where the model parameters are poorly determined due to the lack of data, so that the posterior of the parameters is broad.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Aleatoric uncertainty: is due to the stochasticity of the data, e.g. the noise in the data generation/collection process. Even if the model is given enough data, it cannot make perfect predictions because of that noise."
