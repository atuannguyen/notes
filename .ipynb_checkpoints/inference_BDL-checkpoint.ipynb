We need to minimize the distance from $q_\\phi(\\theta)$ to $p(\\theta|D)$, and a popular distance is the KL from $q$ to $p$.\n",

    "## Monte Carlo Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "Another method is to use MC sampling to sample from $p(\\theta|D)$ (even though we may not know the exact pdf of this distribution). Let's say if we are interested in prediction of a new point $x^*$, which is $\\mathbb{E}_{p(\\theta|D)}\\left[p(y^*|x^*,\\theta)\\right]$, and if we can somehow sample from $p(\\theta|D)$, we can use these samples to approximate the expectation.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Note: These MC methods typically suffer from the curse of dimensionality***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Direct Sampling\n",
    "If we can do direct sampling efficiently and effectively from the desired distribution (not applicable to posterior in neural networks, though), then we can use these samples to approximate the expectation:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Rejection Sampling\n",
    "Suppose $p(x)=p'(x)/Z$ where $Z$ is the normalizing constant and is hard to compute and $p'(x)$ is easy to compute (in the case of posterior for deep learning, $p'(x)$ is the product of likelihood and prior, Z is the $p(D)$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $q(x)$ be an \"arbitrary\" proposal, which we know the form, the pdf, and is easy to sample from.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose a constant $M$ s.t. $\\frac{p'(x)}{q(x)}<M \\quad \\forall x$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the rejection sampling algorithm is:\n",
    "- Sample $x$ from $q(x)$\n",
    "- With probability $\\frac{p'(x)}{Mq(x)}$, accept $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's call this sampling distribution $h(x)$. We have:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "h(x) = \\frac{q(x)\\left(p'(x)/Mq(x)\\right)}{\\int \\left(q(x)\\left(p'(x')/Mq(x')\\right)\\right) dx'}\n",

    "Note: The rejection sampling method can have very high rejection rate in practice, if $q(x)$ differs too much from $p(x)$. In case of high dimensionality, this is very ineffective.\n",

    "\n",
    "Again, suppose $p(x)=p'(x)/Z$ where $Z$ is the normalizing constant. Let $q(x)$ be a proposal and $q$ dominates $p$ (i.e. $p(x)>0 \\rightarrow q(x)>0$)\n",

    "### Weighted Resampling\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow same sampling procedure as Importance Sampling until getting $x_1,x_2,...,x_S$ with normalized weights $w_1,w_2,...,w_S$, then subsample $x$ from $x_1,x_2,...,x_S$ with probability $w_1,w_2,...,w_S$\n",

    "\n",
    "Suppose that we have $N$ states and the transition matrix of the Markov Chain is $T$ ($NxN$). If the chain is ergodic (aperiodic and positive recurrent), it is guaranteed to reach a stationary state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Detailed balance condition: the probability of being in state $x$ and transitioning to state $x'$ must be equal to the probability of being in state $x'$ and transitioning to state $x$. This is a sufficient (but not necessary) condition for a MC to have a stationary state.\n",
    "\n",
    "For continuous variable, we instead \"use a transition kernel\" $T$ and $p^{t+1}(x)=\\int T(x',x)p^t(x')dx'$\n",
    "\n",
    "***High level idea***: MCMC algorithms will generally show you a Markov Chain that will converge to a stationary state that is the desired distribution. One of the most popular algorithm is Metropolis-Hastings.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Metropolis-Hastings algorithm\n",
    "1. Initialization: an arbitrary starting point $x_1$ and a proposal $q(x'|x)$\n",
    "2. At step $t$:\n",
    "    - Sample a point $x'$ from $q(x'|x^t)$.\n",
    "    - $a = min\\left(1,\\frac{p'(x')q(x^t|x')}{p'(x^t)q(x'|x^t)}\\right)$\n",
    "    - With probability $a$ accept $x'$ ($x^{t+1}=x'$) or else reject it ($x^{t+1}=x^t$)\n",
    "    \n",
    "Note that this algorithm only requires the unnormalized pdf $p'(x)$. Also, if $q$ is symmetric ($q(x'|x)=q(x|x')$), then we only need to compute $p'(x')/p'(x)$.\n",
