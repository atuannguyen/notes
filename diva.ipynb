The claim here is that $z_y$ only contain class-specific information, it should be domain-invariant. Therefore, if we can infer $p(z_y|x)$, we can use this domain-invariant feature to give prediction about the class.\n",

    "The authors also found out that the model stills work well, with even better domain generalization performance, when we remove $z_d$ entirely. I think this totally makes sense when $z_d$ doesn't take part in our predictive distribution.\n",

I have tested this model empirically and observed that it reaches the exact performance as the full model. This is totally sensible since as long as we can learn a class-specific feature $z_y$, we can use it to make the prediction well. Note that the reconstruction of $x$ or the learning of $z_x$ and $z_d$ have no effect on the learning of $z_y$.\n",

    "This questions the construction of VAE in this problem. It brings too much computation without any apparent benefits. The only upside is that we can use it to make use of unlabelled data in a semi-supervised learning. However, as reported by the authors, the gain is very marginal. I think it is not surprising since $z_x$ can be used solely for the reconstruction of $x$, and that $z_y$ can be ignored completely. ***In order to force the model to use $z_y$ for the reconstruction (and thus it has to learn $z_y$), we need to constrain $z_x$ such that it doesn't contain class information. Maybe we can minimize $I(Z_d,Y)$***"
